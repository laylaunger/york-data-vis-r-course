@ARTICLE{Wickham2014-nl,
  title    = "Tidy Data",
  author   = "Wickham, Hadley",
  abstract = "A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready
              for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make
              data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper
              tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data
              tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and
              visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a
              column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational
              unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy
              datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal
              with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes
              it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that
              both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a
              consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated
              with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.",
