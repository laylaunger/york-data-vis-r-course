It is also one of the most in-demand skills in both academia and industry.\n\n\n\nDesigning good visualisations isn’t just about producing a chart. It requires practice in matching the right data to the right visualisation, choosing what to emphasise, and making design choices that enhance clarity rather than confuse.\n\n\n\nYou’ll find that creating visualisations can be highly engaging and satisfying.

You will be able to:\n\nExplore and understand datasets by visualising distributions, relationships, and trends.\nDesign clear and comprehensible visualisations that avoid common pitfalls.\nCommunicate findings to diverse audiences through compelling storytelling.\nBuild interactive dashboards that combine multiple visualisations.\nApply these skills across your degree and in a wide range of careers."

Recall that the default facets will show plots horizontally side-by-side, but you can show them vertically by setting nrow to the number of facets (here, the number of experience levels, which is 3). Consider whether it is easier to perceive trends and differences when panels are organized horizontally versus vertically.\n Do the different experience levels show similar effects of policy over time?

    "text": "Preparation for Weeks 2 and 3: Get Acquainted with Tidy Data Wrangling\nThis preparation involves reading some chapters in an online book and getting started with an online DataCamp course. I will recommend this preparation for weeks 2 and 3. You can try taking an initial look in week 2, and revisit the reading more deeply in week 3.\nAlthough the focus of this module is on data visualisation, before you visualise data, you often need to take some steps to get it into a form that you can visualise. These steps are often referred to using phrases like “data management” and “data wrangling”. These days, it is common practice in R to perform steps to ensure that your data are in a standard, “tidy” format in which data are stored in a table where each row is an observation and each column is a variable. Common steps for preparing data for visualisation and analysis include:\n\nGenerating summary statistics, such as the mean value of an outcome variable for groups of participants\nSelecting a subset of data, such as a subset of variables, or rows for just participants in a subset of groups\n\nThe Data Analysis module that you will be completing at the same time will cover many common tidy data wrangling steps, particularly in Weeks 3 and 4. Therefore, we won’t spend much time covering these steps in the seminars for Data Visualisation. However, since this is a crucial part of working with data in R, you will benefit from getting acquainted with it for this module as well.\nThere are many resources for learning about tidy data wrangling. You are encouraged to try the following two resources:\n\nRead Tidyverse Ch 4 - 7\nDataCamp courses on tidyverse and tidy wrangling:\n\nIntroduction to the Tidyverse\nCategorical Data in the Tidyverse\nReshaping Data with tidyr\n\n\n\n\nDistributions\nTo prepare for diving into this week’s topic, visualising distributions:\n\nRead Data Visualization Ch 7 and 9",

Base packages are installed automatically when you install R.\nOther packages, such as ggplot2 (Wickham 2016) need to be installed once and then loaded each session. ggplot2 is one of the tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019) packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you are working on a University computer (or the VDS) you do not need to install tidyverse.\nIf you are working on your own computer or using RStudio cloud you do need to install tidyverse.\n\n\nTo install a package:\n Go the Packages tab on the lower right pane. Click Install and type tidyverse into the box that appears.\nWait until you get the prompt back. It will take a few moments, be patient!\nTo use a package which is installed you have to load it with the library() function. You will need to do this whether you are working on your own computer or on a University computer\n Load the tidyverse. Type or copy the following code into your R script:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n Ensure your cursor is on the line with the code you just added and hit Ctrl+Enter to run it.\nYou can follow this same step to run any code you add to your R script!\nYou will likely be warned of some function name conflicts but these will not be a problem for you.",

    "text": "Preparation for Weeks 2 and 3: Get Acquainted with Tidy Data Wrangling\nThis preparation involves reading some chapters in an online book and getting started with an online DataCamp course. I will recommend this preparation for weeks 2 and 3. You can try taking an initial look in week 2, and revisit the reading more deeply in week 3.\nAlthough the focus of this module is on data visualisation, before you visualise data, you often need to take some steps to get it into a form that you can visualise. These steps are often referred to using phrases like “data management” and “data wrangling”. These days, it is common practice in R to perform steps to ensure that your data are in a standard, “tidy” format in which data are stored in a table where each row is an observation and each column is a variable. Common steps for preparing data for visualisation and analysis include:\n\nGenerating summary statistics, such as the mean value of an outcome variable for groups of participants\nSelecting a subset of data, such as a subset of variables, or rows for just participants in a subset of groups\n\nThe Data Analysis module that you will be completing at the same time will cover many common tidy data wrangling steps, particularly in Weeks 3 and 4. Therefore, we won’t spend much time covering these steps in the seminars for Data Visualisation. However, since this is a crucial part of working with data in R, you will benefit from getting acquainted with it for this module as well.\nThere are many resources for learning about tidy data wrangling. You are encouraged to try the following two resources:\n\nRead Tidyverse Ch 4 - 7\nDataCamp courses on tidyverse and tidy wrangling:\n\nIntroduction to the Tidyverse\nCategorical Data in the Tidyverse\nReshaping Data with tidyr",
