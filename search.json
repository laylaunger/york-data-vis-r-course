    "text": "As in Week 8, these consolidation exercises will ask you to apply what you learned in the seminar and practical to another dataset.\nIn these exercises, you will re-use a dataset and code from an earlier week to create your own Shiny app, using the same ideas and structure that you saw in the seminar and practical:\n\nA single app.R file (in its own project folder)\nA ui and server plus shinyApp(ui, server)\nInputs (e.g., dropdown, checkbox) that control what the plot shows\nA reactive plot that updates when the user changes the inputs\n\nYou will:\n\nAdapt wrangling and plotting ideas from one earlier week (e.g., Week 3, 4, 5, or 6)\nSet up a project folder with a data/ subfolder and an app.R file\nBuild a Shiny app with at least:\n\ntwo user inputs, such as a dropdown that switches between two outcomes and a checkbox that turns an extra layer on or off\none main plot that reacts to these inputs\n\nAdd comments and sensible labels so someone else can understand and use your app\n\nYou do not need to invent an extremely complex dashboard. The goal is to consolidate the core Shiny ideas from Week 9 using a dataset you already know.\nNote:\nThe steps below guide you through creating a shiny app with similar features to the ones covered in week 9. If you want to try exploring features mentioned in the reading, in DataCamp or elsewhere, feel free!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\n\nThese four symbols are used at the beginning of each instruction so you know where to carry out the instruction.\n Something you need to do on your computer outside of RStudio. It may be opening programs or documents or locating a file.\n Something you should do in RStudio. It will usually involve writing or running R code, but might also be creating folders, locating or moving files.\n Something you should do in your browser, like searching for information, going to the VLE or downloading a file.\n A question for you to think about and answer. You should usually record your answers in your script/app for future reference.\n\n\n\n\n\nStart by deciding which earlier week you want to build on.\nChoose an earlier practical or consolidation as the basis for this Week 9 app, such as:\n\nWeek 4 — Barplots\n\nWeek 5 — Relationships\n\nWeek 6 — Time series & line graphs\n\n Open the R script from your chosen week and quickly skim what you did.\n In a few bullet points (keep this in a comment at the top of app.R later), note:\n\nWhich dataset you plan to use\n\nWhich two outcomes or views your app might switch between\n\ne.g. two different outcome variables, or two different ways of aggregating the same variable\n\nWhich plot features your app might toggle off or on\n\nYou can keep these notes short; they are just to orient you.\n\n\n\nNow you will create a fresh project specifically for this consolidation report, using the same structure as in the Week 9 practical.\n In RStudio, in the Files tab (Rstudio bottom right panel), create a new folder somewhere sensible (for example inside data-visualisation-in-r). Give it a clear name that relates to the graphs you will use in the app, such as consolidate9_barplots.\nWe will refer to this as project_name/.\nThis is the first step for building your project structure. Once you finish the additional setup steps below, your project structure should look like this:\nproject_name/\n  project_name.Rproj\n  app.R\n  data/\n    &lt;one or more CSV files&gt;\n  \n Turn this folder into an RStudio Project:\n\nClick the project dropdown in the top-right of RStudio (see the little icon with the blue cube)\n\nChoose New Project → Existing Directory\n\nSelect your new project_name/ folder and click Create Project.\n\n Inside this project, create a subfolder called data.\n Copy the relevant CSV file(s) from the original week into this data folder.\n\n\n\n\n In RStudio (inside your new project):\n\nCreate a new R Script and save it as app.R in project_name/.\n\nAt the top of app.R, load the packages you need, for example:\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(viridis)\nThen load your dataset from the data/ folder, using a clear object name:\nmy_df &lt;- read_csv(\"data/your_dataset.csv\")\nReplace \"your_dataset.csv\" and my_df with names that make sense for your data.\n\n\n\nNow you will add a basic Shiny structure.\n In app.R, under the data loading code, add a minimal Shiny app skeleton:\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n\n)\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\n Inside fluidPage(), add:\n\nAdd a titlePanel() with a clear title.\n\nAdd a short instruction paragraph with p() that tells the user how they can interact with the page (you will add the interactive user inputs in the next step).\n\n\n\n\nNext, you will design the controls that make your app interactive.\n Think about your chosen dataset and answer (in comments in app.R):\n\nWhich two outcomes or views should the user be able to switch between?\n\ne.g. two different numerical outcome variables, as we did in the seminar and practical\n\nWhich extra feature would be useful to turn on/off with a checkbox?\n\ne.g. show/hide raw points, show/hide a regression line, show/hide a smoothing line\n\n\n Inside fluidPage() of your ui, after the static elements, add:\n\nA dropdown menu that lets the user choose between two options\nA checkbox that controls an extra layer\n\nMake sure that you use sensible choices for inputId, label, and other relevant arguments.\n Save app.R and click Run App. Your user inputs won’t do anything yet, but check that:\n\nThe dropdown appears with sensible labels\n\nThe checkbox appears and can be ticked/unticked\n\n\n\n\nThe last thing you need in your UI is the plot, which will be generated in the server function that you will customise in the next exercise.\n Think of a name to use to refer to your output plot, and as the last line within fluidPage, add plotOutput(\"name_of_output_plot\") (insert your choice of name)\n\n\n\nNow you will flesh out the server function to dynamically update the plot you included in the ui.\n Go to the server function part of your skeleton and flesh out the server logic:\n\nInside the curly braces {}, create an output using renderPlot(). The name of the output should be the same as the name you created in the ui in Exercise 7.\n\noutput$name_of_output_plot &lt;- renderPlot({\n\n  # your ggplot code will go here\n\n})\n\nUse an if/else pattern to check the value of the dropdown menu input. Remember to refer to the inputId you used when you defined the dropdown menu in the ui using the input$ notation. Within the if block, define the plot that should appear if the user selects one of the dropdown options; within the else block, define the plot that should appear if the user selects the other dropdown option. Each block should assign the ggplot code to a named object, like output_plot.\nAdd an if block that checks the value of the checkbox input, remembering to refer to the inputId you used when you defined the checkbox in the ui. Within the block, add a layer to the plot defined in step 2 if the user checks the checkbox.\nAdd a final line consisting just of the name of the plot you defined. This is needed to tell Shiny to draw the plot.\n\nOnce completed, your code will look something like this:\noutput$name_of_output_plot &lt;- renderPlot({\n\n  if (input$xxx == \"option1\") {\n    output_plot &lt;- my_df |&gt;\n      ggplot(aes(x = ..., y = ...)) +\n      geom_...\n  } else {\n    output_plot &lt;- my_df |&gt;\n      ggplot(aes(x = ..., y = ...)) +\n      geom_...\n  }\n\n  if (input$yyy)  {\n    output_plot &lt;- output_plot +\n      geom_...\n  }\n\n  output_plot\n})\n\n Save app.R and click Run App. Change the selection in your dropdown and check the box to confirm that the plot updates as intended.\n In your own words (as a comment in app.R), describe what each if/else block is doing.\n\n\n\nAt this point, you may want to polish the appearance of your plots. For example, you might:\n\nImprove the title of the shiny app\nImprove plot labels or colors\n\nTo help you understand and adapt this code in the future, you might want to add comments that explain what each part does, for example:\n\nAbove the data loading code\n\nAbove the ui &lt;- fluidPage(...) section\n\nAbove the server &lt;- function(...) { ... } section\n\nAbove any if/else blocks\n\n Imagine another student in the course downloads only your project_name/ folder. Would they be able to:\n\nUnderstand what the app is for?\n\nWork out what the inputs do?\n\nInterpret what the plot is showing?\n\nIf not, tweak labels and comments until the answer is “yes”.\n In a comment at the bottom of app.R, or in a separate text file in the project folder, briefly answer:\n\nWhat question is your app helping to answer about this dataset?\n\nWhat did you learn from turning your earlier analysis into an interactive app?\n\nIf you had more time, what is one extra feature you would add next?",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nSocial support and access to therapy are both thought to play an important role in protecting mental health. This short report uses a simulated dataset of 400 adults to explore how perceived support and therapy use relate to wellbeing and loneliness.\nParticipants reported their support level (low, medium, or high), whether they were currently in therapy, and completed assessments of wellbeing and loneliness that were subsequently scored. The aim of the report is to summarise how these variables relate to one another.\nThis report first examines how wellbeing and loneliness differ across support levels, and then reveals the impact of therapy.\nData overview\nThe dataset contains the following key variables:\n\n\nSupport level (support_level): perceived social support (Low, Medium, High).\n\nTherapy (therapy): whether the participant is currently receiving therapy (Yes/No).\n\nLoneliness score (loneliness_score): higher values indicate greater loneliness.\n\nWellbeing score (wellbeing_score): higher values indicate better wellbeing.\n\nIn what follows, I focus on how wellbeing and loneliness vary across levels of support and therapy.\nSupport level affects wellbeing and loneliness\nWe first examine wellbeing and loneliness scores by support level. The pattern is clear: participants with low perceived support report the lowest wellbeing and highest loneliness. As support increases, wellbeing also increases, whereas loneliness decreases. Thus, support improves wellbeing and decreases loneliness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Wellbeing scores by perceived support level.\n\n\n\n\nTherapy partially mitigates effects of support\nWe next compare wellbeing for participants who are and are not in therapy. On average, those in therapy report higher wellbeing than those who are not, across all levels of support. However, therapy does not affect reported levels of loneliness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Wellbeing scores for participants in therapy and not in therapy.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nThis short report used a simulated dataset to explore how social support, therapy, and sleep quality relate to wellbeing and loneliness. Key patterns emerged. First, higher perceived support is associated with higher wellbeing and lower loneliness. In addition, participants in therapy report somewhat higher wellbeing than those not in therapy. However, therapy has no apparent effect on reported loneliness.\nThe report demonstrates how Quarto can combine text, code, and figures to tell a coherent data story. In a full analysis, one might extend these descriptive findings using formal statistical models and explore additional predictors, such as age or sex. Here, the focus has been on producing a clear, reproducible summary that highlights key patterns in the data."

There is a hidden default value for an argument in geom_bar() called “stat”, that indicates what kind of statistic should determine the height of the bar. By default the value is “count”, so tht it counts the frequency of each unique value in that variable, and that’s the height of the bar.",

    "text": "Preparation for Weeks 2 and 3: Get Acquainted with Tidy Data Wrangling\nThis preparation involves reading some chapters in an online book and getting started with an online DataCamp course. I will recommend this preparation for weeks 2 and 3. You can try taking an initial look in week 2, and revisit the reading more deeply in week 3.\nAlthough the focus of this module is on data visualisation, before you visualise data, you often need to take some steps to get it into a form that you can visualise. These steps are often referred to using phrases like “data management” and “data wrangling”. These days, it is common practice in R to perform steps to ensure that your data are in a standard, “tidy” format in which data are stored in a table where each row is an observation and each column is a variable. Common steps for preparing data for visualisation and analysis include:\n\nGenerating summary statistics, such as the mean value of an outcome variable for groups of participants\nSelecting a subset of data, such as a subset of variables, or rows for just participants in a subset of groups\n\nThe Data Analysis module that you will be completing at the same time will cover many common tidy data wrangling steps, particularly in Weeks 3 and 4. Therefore, we won’t spend much time covering these steps in the seminars for Data Visualisation. However, since this is a crucial part of working with data in R, you will benefit from getting acquainted with it for this module as well.\nThere are many resources for learning about tidy data wrangling. You are encouraged to try the following two resources:\n\nRead Tidyverse Ch 4 - 7\nDataCamp courses on tidyverse and tidy wrangling:\n\nIntroduction to the Tidyverse\nCategorical Data in the Tidyverse\nReshaping Data with tidyr",

It may be opening programs or documents or locating a file.\n Something you should do in RStudio. It will usually involve writing or running R code, but might also be creating folders, locating or moving files.\n Something you should do in your browser, like searching for information, going to the VLE or downloading a file.\n A question for you to think about and answer. You should usually record your answers in your script/app for future reference.\n\n\n\n\n\nStart by deciding what you want your Week 10 app to explore.\nFor a rich enough dataset to produce multiple plots and variations, you may want to adapt the Week 5 or Week 6 dataset (the Week 4 dataset may not have enough variables / patterns to make use of the Week 10 features).\n Open the R script from your chosen week and quickly skim what you did.\n Note:\n\nWhich dataset you plan to use\nWhich two continuous outcomes you might let the user switch between (for the outcome dropdown)\nWhich grouping variable you might:\n\nuse as a filter (in a checkbox group)\nuse in a facet or second tab\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a fresh project for this Week 10 consolidation app.\n In RStudio, in the Files tab (bottom-right panel), create a new folder somewhere sensible (for example inside data-visualisation-in-r). Give it a clear name that relates to the graphs you will use in the app, such as consolidate10_dashboard.\nWe will refer to this as project_name/.\nYour goal is to have a structure like:\nproject_name/\n  project_name.Rproj\n  app.R\n  data/\n    &lt;one or more CSV files&gt;\n Turn this folder into an RStudio Project:\n\nClick the project dropdown in the top-right of RStudio\n\nChoose New Project → Existing Directory\n\nSelect your new project_name/ folder and click Create Project\n\n Inside this project, create a subfolder called data.\n Copy the relevant CSV file(s) from the original week into this data folder.\n\n\n\n In RStudio (inside your new project):\n\nCreate a new R Script and save it as app.R in project_name/.\n\nAt the top of app.R, load the packages you need, for example:\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(viridis)\nThen load your dataset from the data/ folder, using a clear object name:\nmy_df &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"data/your_dataset.csv\")\nReplace \"your_dataset.csv\" and my_df with names that make sense for your data.\nIf you have a grouping variable, you may want to reorder it with factor() and levels = ... as in earlier weeks.\n In a brief comment above your data-loading code, describe: - What the dataset represents - Which variables you expect to use in your app\n\n\n\n Make sure app.R contains the basic Shiny structure:\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n\n)\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\nIn Week 10 we moved from a simple fluidPage() with a single plot to a sidebar layout with multiple tabs.\nYour goal is to have a UI structure like this:\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  titlePanel(\"Your dashboard title\"),\n  p(\"Short instructions for what users can explore.\"),\n\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      # inputs (dropdowns, checkboxes, etc.)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      tabsetPanel(\n        tabPanel(\n          title = \"Tab 1 title\",\n          # tab-specific inputs (if any) and plotOutput(...)\n        ),\n        tabPanel(\n          title = \"Tab 2 title\",\n          # tab-specific inputs (if any) and plotOutput(...)\n        )\n      )\n    )\n  )\n)\n Edit your ui &lt;- fluidPage(...) so that it:\n\nIncludes a titlePanel() with a clear title\n\nIncludes a short p() paragraph explaining what the app will show\n\nUses sidebarLayout() with sidebarPanel() and mainPanel()\n\nInside mainPanel(), uses tabsetPanel() with two tabPanel()s, such as:\n\nTab 1: a view focused on one grouping (e.g., group differences)\nTab 2: a view that uses faceting or a different outcome\n\n\nEach tab should contain at least one plotOutput() with a clear name\n Save app.R and click Run App. You should see:\n\nA title and short paragraph\n\nA sidebar on the left (currently empty)\n\nTwo tabs with empty plot areas on the right\n\n\n\n\nNow you’ll add global inputs in the sidebar that affect both tabs, such as:\n\nA dropdown to choose between two continuous outcomes\n\nA checkbox group filter to control which groups appear in the plots\n\n In a comment inside sidebarPanel(), note:\n\nWhich variable you will use for the outcome dropdown (two options)\n\nWhich variable you will use for the group filter (e.g., support level, participant group, job type)\n\n Inside sidebarPanel(), add:\n\nA selectInput() for a dropdown menu. Remember to fill out the inputID, label, choices and selected arguments.\nA checkboxGroupInput(). Remember to fill out the inputID, label, choices and selected arguments.\n\n Inside one of the tabPanels, add:\n\nA checkboxInput().

    "text": "Preparation for Weeks 2 and 3: Get Acquainted with Tidy Data Wrangling\nThis preparation involves reading some chapters in an online book and getting started with an online DataCamp course. I will recommend this preparation for weeks 2 and 3. You can try taking an initial look in week 2, and revisit the reading more deeply in week 3.\nAlthough the focus of this module is on data visualisation, before you visualise data, you often need to take some steps to get it into a form that you can visualise. These steps are often referred to using phrases like “data management” and “data wrangling”. These days, it is common practice in R to perform steps to ensure that your data are in a standard, “tidy” format in which data are stored in a table where each row is an observation and each column is a variable. Common steps for preparing data for visualisation and analysis include:\n\nGenerating summary statistics, such as the mean value of an outcome variable for groups of participants\nSelecting a subset of data, such as a subset of variables, or rows for just participants in a subset of groups\n\nThe Data Analysis module that you will be completing at the same time will cover many common tidy data wrangling steps, particularly in Weeks 3 and 4. Therefore, we won’t spend much time covering these steps in the seminars for Data Visualisation. However, since this is a crucial part of working with data in R, you will benefit from getting acquainted with it for this module as well.\nThere are many resources for learning about tidy data wrangling. You are encouraged to try the following two resources:\n\nRead Tidyverse Ch 4 - 7\nDataCamp courses on tidyverse and tidy wrangling:\n\nIntroduction to the Tidyverse\nCategorical Data in the Tidyverse\nReshaping Data with tidyr\n\n\n\n\nDistributions\nTo prepare for diving into this week’s topic, visualising distributions:\n\nRead Data Visualization Ch 7 and 9",

E.g., we were looking at the relationship between training huors and perfrmance befre. And we had seen that employees with more training hours had a higher performance index.\nBut maybe that relationship differs across people who have been with the company for different amounts of time. For example, maybe completing more training hours is especially helpful for employees who are just starting out and have been with the company for less than a year.\nIf we wanted to look at that, we need to pull information from BOTH these datasets.",

For example…\nBut wouldn’t it be so much easier to grasp these correlations in a visual form? Like, what if we could use color to indicate whether a correlation was positive or negative, and how strong the correlation is?\nSo that’s our goal. Take this numeric matrix and turn it into a more easy to grasp visual.\nAt this point we have a couple different options. There are various packages that people have written that visualize correlation matrices.",

This would be a lot to cram into one plot - multiple lines would overlap and make them difficult to disentangle.\nWhen multiple groups overlap, it can be easier to facet.\n Adapt your code from the previous exercise to facet by experience. Recall that the default facets will show plots horizontally side-by-side, but you can show them vertically by setting nrow to the number of facets (here, the number of experience levels, which is 3). Consider whether it is easier to perceive trends and differences when panels are organized horizontally versus vertically.\n Do the different experience levels show similar effects of policy over time? How does uncertainty / variability influence your perception of effects (if any)?",

This short report uses a simulated dataset of 400 adults to explore how perceived support and therapy use relate to wellbeing and loneliness.\nParticipants reported their support level (low, medium, or high), whether they were currently in therapy, and completed assessments of wellbeing and loneliness that were subsequently scored. The aim of the report is to summarise how these variables relate to one another.\nThis report first examines how wellbeing and loneliness differ across support levels, and then reveals the impact of therapy.\nData overview\nThe dataset contains the following key variables:\n\n\nSupport level (support_level): perceived social support (Low, Medium, High).\n\nTherapy (therapy): whether the participant is currently receiving therapy (Yes/No).\n\nLoneliness score (loneliness_score): higher values indicate greater loneliness.\n\nWellbeing score (wellbeing_score): higher values indicate better wellbeing.\n\nIn what follows, I focus on how wellbeing and loneliness vary across levels of support and therapy.\nSupport level affects wellbeing and loneliness\nWe first examine wellbeing and loneliness scores by support level. The pattern is clear: participants with low perceived support report the lowest wellbeing and highest loneliness. As support increases, wellbeing also increases, whereas loneliness decreases. Thus, support improves wellbeing and decreases loneliness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Wellbeing scores by perceived support level."

Practicing how to build a polished Quarto report will be useful preparation for both the final assessment and for communicating your work with other people.\nYou will:\n\nAdapt plots and wrangling code from one earlier week: Week 3, 4, 5, or 6\nSet up a project folder with a data/ subfolder\nCreate a Quarto report with a YAML header, setup chunk, and sections\nAdd chunk labels, chunk options, and inline code\nWrite short plain-language interpretations of your plots\n\nYou do not need to invent entirely new visualizations here. The goal is to practice turning code you have already written into a clear, reproducible report. To accomplish this goal, you can harness the polishing strategies from week 7 and the Quarto report approaches from week 8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\n\nThese four symbols are used at the beginning of each instruction so you know where to carry out the instruction.\n Something you need to do on your computer. It may be opening programs or documents or locating a file.\n Something you should do in RStudio. It will often be typing a command or using the menus but might also be creating folders, locating or moving files.\n Something you should do in your browser on the internet. It may be searching for information, going to the VLE or downloading a file.\n A question for you to think about and answer. Record your answers in your report or script for future reference.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose an earlier practical or consolidation as the basis for this Week 8 report, such as:\n\nWeek 4 — Barplots\n\nWeek 5 — Relationships\n\nWeek 6 — Time series & line graphs\n\n Open the R script from that week. Quickly skim what you did.\n In a sentence or two, jot down: - Which dataset you plan to use - Which 2–3 plots you want to showcase in your report.\nYou can keep this plan outline short; it’s just to orient yourself.\n\n\n\nNow you will create a fresh project specifically for this consolidation report, using the same structure as in the Week 8 practical.\n In RStudio, in the Files tab (Rstudio bottom right panel), create a new folder somewhere sensible (for example inside data-visualisation-in-r). Give it a clear name that relates to the graphs you will use in the report, such as consolidate8_barplots.\nWe will refer to this as project_name/.\nThis is the first step for building your project structure. Once you finish the additional setup steps below, your project structure should look like this:\nproject_name/\n  project_name.Rproj\n  consolidate8_report.qmd\n  data/\n    &lt;one or more CSV files&gt;\n  \n Turn this folder into an RStudio Project:\n\nClick the project dropdown in the top-right of RStudio (see the little icon with the blue cube)\n\nChoose New Project → Existing Directory\n\nSelect your new project_name/ folder and click Create Project.\n\n Inside this project, create a subfolder called data.\n Copy the relevant CSV file(s) from the original week into this data folder.\n Why is it helpful to keep all files needed for your report (data, .qmd, project file) together in one project folder?\n\n\n\nNow you will create the skeleton Quarto report.\n In RStudio (inside your new project):\n\nGo to File → New File → Quarto Document…\n\nGive it a clear title that mentions your topic and dataset, e.g.:\n\nEngagement Across User Segments and Devices\n\n\nList yourself as the author\nChoose HTML as the format.\n\nClick Create, then immediately save the file as consolidate8_report.qmd inside project_name/.\n\n Replace the default YAML at the top of the new .qmd with something similar to:\n---\ntitle: \"Engagement Across User Segments and Devices\"\nauthor: \"XXX\"\ndate: \"2025-11-15\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    toc-depth: 2\n    number-sections: false\n    self-contained: true\nexecute:\n  message: false\n  warning: false\n---\n What does the format: section of the YAML control?\n\n\n\nUnderneath the YAML, you now need a setup chunk that:\n\nLoads any packages you need\n\nReads in the relevant dataset(s) from the data/ folder\n\nDoes any basic recoding (e.g., factor ordering) or processing\n\nOptionally sets a default theme\n\n Test run the chunk within RStudio (using the green arrow). Fix any errors about missing packages or incorrect file paths.\n Save and Render your report.\n After your setup chunk runs successfully, what (if anything) do you see in the HTML report? Why?\n\n\n\nNext, you’ll add a clear section structure using Markdown headings.\n Underneath your setup chunk, add headings like:\n# Introduction\n\n# Data overview\n\n# [key result 1]\n\n# [key result 2]\n\n# Summary\nYou can adapt the key results to your topic, e.g., # App engagement by user segment\n\n\n\n In the # Data overview section, add a code chunk that shows the top few rows of the dataset and a brief Markdown description. Test run the chunk and render the file to check that everything runs / displays as intended.\n\n\n\nNow the main step: adapt plots from your earlier script and translate them into Quarto chunks inside your report.\nAim for at least two plots that form a coherent story (e.g., different views of the same phenomenon, or related outcomes).\n For each plot you want to include:\n\nCopy the ggplot code from your original script.\nPaste it into an R chunk in the appropriate section of your report.\nAdd a chunk label and useful chunk options\nTest run it to see how it looks.\nPolish the plot using strategies from Advanced Customisation (Week 7)\nRender and try adjusting the options controlling figure appearance until you’re happy with how it looks.\nAdd a brief description of the key result to the section.\n\n Repeat this for your other chosen plots. Remember that each of your code chunks should have a different label.\n\n\n\nConsidering your inspection of the dataset and the patterns:\n\nAdd a few sentences to the # Introduction section to introduce the dataset and the patterns that the report will depict.\nTry including a sentence that notes the number of participants in the dataset (or some other useful bit of information) with inline code.\nAdd a few sentences to the # Summary section to summarise the patterns shown in the plots.\n\n\n\n\n Render your report and read it through from beginning to end. Imagine you are reading this report for the first time and are unfamiliar with the data / results.\n\nDoes it tell a clear and compelling story?\nAre the figures easy to read?\nCould you change anything to improve the narrative or plots further?",

    "text": "Exercise 6: Explore additional user input controls\nWe’ve covered some useful user input controls, including dropdown menus, single checkboxes, and groups of checkboxes. However, these aren’t the only controls available! When creating apps in the future (for your final assessment and beyond), you may want to include other controls. You can find the full set of controls you can implement in Shiny by following the link below. Note that these controls are referred to as “widgets”.\n Explore the Widget Gallery\n What other widgets might be useful in the future? Radio buttons? Sliders?",

    "text": "Exercise 7: Add a reactive filtered dataset\nIn Seminar 10, you saw how to use a reactive expression to create a function that returns a filtered dataset based on user input.\nHere, you’ll create a filtered_data() function that:\n\nStarts from wellbeing_df\n\nKeeps only observations whose participant_group is in input$group_filter\n\nUpdates automatically whenever the user changes the group checkboxes\n\nRemember: input$group_filter is a vector of strings (e.g., c(\"student\", \"employed\", \"retired\")). The specific strings in this vector depend on which boxes are ticked.\n In app.R, go to the server function. Inside the curly braces {}, above any plotting code, add a reactive expression:\n\nUse filtered_data &lt;- reactive({ ... })\n\nInside the curly braces for reactive({ ... }), write tidyverse code that:\n\nStarts from wellbeing_df\n\nUses filter() with %in% and input$group_filter to keep only rows whose participant_group is currently selected\n\n\n\n What is one advantage of using a filtered_data() reactive expression instead of repeating the same filter() code inside each plot?",
