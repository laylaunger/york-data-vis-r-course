    "text": "Data Visualisation in R helps you transform complex datasets into clear, compelling, and insightful stories.\n\n\nModern life produces massive amounts of data, from medical records and government reports to consumer behaviour and scientific experiments. These raw data are often impossible to interpret directly. Effective visualisation is what makes patterns, relationships, and insights easy to grasp. It is also one of the most in-demand skills in both academia and industry.\n\n\n\nDesigning good visualisations isn’t just about producing a chart. It requires practice in matching the right data to the right visualisation, choosing what to emphasise, and making design choices that enhance clarity rather than confuse.\n\n\n\nYou’ll find that creating visualisations can be highly engaging and satisfying. There is an immediate reward when a messy dataset suddenly becomes a meaningful picture. You’ll also discover creative opportunities—choosing colours, layouts, and styles that make your work both clear and attractive. By the end of the course you’ll be able to build professional-quality figures, dashboards, and even interactive apps that you can proudly showcase.\nThe time and effort you put into learning Data Visualisation in R WILL reward you no matter how you evaluate yourself relative to others. You will be able to:\n\nExplore and understand datasets by visualising distributions, relationships, and trends.\nDesign clear and comprehensible visualisations that avoid common pitfalls.\nCommunicate findings to diverse audiences through compelling storytelling.\nBuild interactive dashboards that combine multiple visualisations.\nApply these skills across your degree and in a wide range of careers."

    "text": "Preparation for Weeks 2 and 3: Get Acquainted with Tidy Data Wrangling\nThis preparation involves reading some chapters in an online book and getting started with an online DataCamp course. I will recommend this preparation for weeks 2 and 3. You can try taking an initial look in week 2, and revisit the reading more deeply in week 3.\nAlthough the focus of this module is on data visualisation, before you visualise data, you often need to take some steps to get it into a form that you can visualise. These steps are often referred to using phrases like “data management” and “data wrangling”. These days, it is common practice in R to perform steps to ensure that your data are in a standard, “tidy” format in which data are stored in a table where each row is an observation and each column is a variable. Common steps for preparing data for visualisation and analysis include:\n\nGenerating summary statistics, such as the mean value of an outcome variable for groups of participants\nSelecting a subset of data, such as a subset of variables, or rows for just participants in a subset of groups\n\nThe Data Analysis module that you will be completing at the same time will cover many common tidy data wrangling steps, particularly in Weeks 3 and 4. Therefore, we won’t spend much time covering these steps in the seminars for Data Visualisation. However, since this is a crucial part of working with data in R, you will benefit from getting acquainted with it for this module as well.\nThere are many resources for learning about tidy data wrangling. You are encouraged to try the following two resources:\n\nRead Tidyverse Ch 4 - 7\nDataCamp courses on tidyverse and tidy wrangling:\n\nIntroduction to the Tidyverse\nCategorical Data in the Tidyverse\nReshaping Data with tidyr",

    "text": "Preparation for Weeks 2 and 3: Get Acquainted with Tidy Data Wrangling\nThis preparation involves reading some chapters in an online book and getting started with an online DataCamp course. I will recommend this preparation for weeks 2 and 3. You can try taking an initial look in week 2, and revisit the reading more deeply in week 3.\nAlthough the focus of this module is on data visualisation, before you visualise data, you often need to take some steps to get it into a form that you can visualise. These steps are often referred to using phrases like “data management” and “data wrangling”. These days, it is common practice in R to perform steps to ensure that your data are in a standard, “tidy” format in which data are stored in a table where each row is an observation and each column is a variable. Common steps for preparing data for visualisation and analysis include:\n\nGenerating summary statistics, such as the mean value of an outcome variable for groups of participants\nSelecting a subset of data, such as a subset of variables, or rows for just participants in a subset of groups\n\nThe Data Analysis module that you will be completing at the same time will cover many common tidy data wrangling steps, particularly in Weeks 3 and 4. Therefore, we won’t spend much time covering these steps in the seminars for Data Visualisation. However, since this is a crucial part of working with data in R, you will benefit from getting acquainted with it for this module as well.\nThere are many resources for learning about tidy data wrangling. You are encouraged to try the following two resources:\n\nRead Tidyverse Ch 4 - 7\nDataCamp courses on tidyverse and tidy wrangling:\n\nIntroduction to the Tidyverse\nCategorical Data in the Tidyverse\nReshaping Data with tidyr\n\n\n\n\nDistributions\nTo prepare for diving into this week’s topic, visualising distributions:\n\nRead Data Visualization Ch 7 and 9",

We’ve got this correlation matrix, and we can spend a while staring at the numbers and trying to interpret what they mean. For example…\nBut wouldn’t it be so much easier to grasp these correlations in a visual form? Like, what if we could use color to indicate whether a correlation was positive or negative, and how strong the correlation is?\nSo that’s our goal. Take this numeric matrix and turn it into a more easy to grasp visual.\nAt this point we have a couple different options. There are various packages that people have written that visualize correlation matrices.",

This would be a lot to cram into one plot - multiple lines would overlap and make them difficult to disentangle.\nWhen multiple groups overlap, it can be easier to facet.\n Adapt your code from the previous exercise to facet by experience. Recall that the default facets will show plots horizontally side-by-side, but you can show them vertically by setting nrow to the number of facets (here, the number of experience levels, which is 3). Consider whether it is easier to perceive trends and differences when panels are organized horizontally versus vertically.\n Do the different experience levels show similar effects of policy over time? How does uncertainty / variability influence your perception of effects (if any)?",
