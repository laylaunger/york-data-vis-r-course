    "text": "As in Week 8, these consolidation exercises will ask you to apply what you learned in the seminar and practical to another dataset.\nIn these exercises, you will re-use a dataset and code from an earlier week to create your own Shiny app, using the same ideas and structure that you saw in the seminar and practical:\n\nA single app.R file (in its own project folder)\nA ui and server plus shinyApp(ui, server)\nInputs (e.g., dropdown, checkbox) that control what the plot shows\nA reactive plot that updates when the user changes the inputs\n\nYou will:\n\nAdapt wrangling and plotting ideas from one earlier week (e.g., Week 3, 4, 5, or 6)\nSet up a project folder with a data/ subfolder and an app.R file\nBuild a Shiny app with at least:\n\ntwo user inputs, such as a dropdown that switches between two outcomes and a checkbox that turns an extra layer on or off\none main plot that reacts to these inputs\n\nAdd comments and sensible labels so someone else can understand and use your app\n\nYou do not need to invent an extremely complex dashboard. The goal is to consolidate the core Shiny ideas from Week 9 using a dataset you already know.\nNote:\nThe steps below guide you through creating a shiny app with similar features to the ones covered in week 9. If you want to try exploring features mentioned in the reading, in DataCamp or elsewhere, feel free!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\n\nThese four symbols are used at the beginning of each instruction so you know where to carry out the instruction.\n Something you need to do on your computer outside of RStudio. It may be opening programs or documents or locating a file.\n Something you should do in RStudio. It will usually involve writing or running R code, but might also be creating folders, locating or moving files.\n Something you should do in your browser, like searching for information, going to the VLE or downloading a file.\n A question for you to think about and answer. You should usually record your answers in your script/app for future reference.\n\n\n\n\n\nStart by deciding which earlier week you want to build on.\nChoose an earlier practical or consolidation as the basis for this Week 9 app, such as:\n\nWeek 4 — Barplots\n\nWeek 5 — Relationships\n\nWeek 6 — Time series & line graphs\n\n Open the R script from your chosen week and quickly skim what you did.\n In a few bullet points (keep this in a comment at the top of app.R later), note:\n\nWhich dataset you plan to use\n\nWhich two outcomes or views your app might switch between\n\ne.g. two different outcome variables, or two different ways of aggregating the same variable\n\nWhich plot features your app might toggle off or on\n\nYou can keep these notes short; they are just to orient you.\n\n\n\nNow you will create a fresh project specifically for this consolidation report, using the same structure as in the Week 9 practical.\n In RStudio, in the Files tab (Rstudio bottom right panel), create a new folder somewhere sensible (for example inside data-visualisation-in-r). Give it a clear name that relates to the graphs you will use in the app, such as consolidate9_barplots.\nWe will refer to this as project_name/.\nThis is the first step for building your project structure. Once you finish the additional setup steps below, your project structure should look like this:\nproject_name/\n  project_name.Rproj\n  app.R\n  data/\n    &lt;one or more CSV files&gt;\n  \n Turn this folder into an RStudio Project:\n\nClick the project dropdown in the top-right of RStudio (see the little icon with the blue cube)\n\nChoose New Project → Existing Directory\n\nSelect your new project_name/ folder and click Create Project.\n\n Inside this project, create a subfolder called data.\n Copy the relevant CSV file(s) from the original week into this data folder.\n\n\n\n\n In RStudio (inside your new project):\n\nCreate a new R Script and save it as app.R in project_name/.\n\nAt the top of app.R, load the packages you need, for example:\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(viridis)\nThen load your dataset from the data/ folder, using a clear object name:\nmy_df &lt;- read_csv(\"data/your_dataset.csv\")\nReplace \"your_dataset.csv\" and my_df with names that make sense for your data.\n\n\n\nNow you will add a basic Shiny structure.\n In app.R, under the data loading code, add a minimal Shiny app skeleton:\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n\n)\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\n Inside fluidPage(), add:\n\nAdd a titlePanel() with a clear title.\n\nAdd a short instruction paragraph with p() that tells the user how they can interact with the page (you will add the interactive user inputs in the next step).\n\n\n\n\nNext, you will design the controls that make your app interactive.\n Think about your chosen dataset and answer (in comments in app.R):\n\nWhich two outcomes or views should the user be able to switch between?\n\ne.g. two different numerical outcome variables, as we did in the seminar and practical\n\nWhich extra feature would be useful to turn on/off with a checkbox?\n\ne.g. show/hide raw points, show/hide a regression line, show/hide a smoothing line\n\n\n Inside fluidPage() of your ui, after the static elements, add:\n\nA dropdown menu that lets the user choose between two options\nA checkbox that controls an extra layer\n\nMake sure that you use sensible choices for inputId, label, and other relevant arguments.\n Save app.R and click Run App. Your user inputs won’t do anything yet, but check that:\n\nThe dropdown appears with sensible labels\n\nThe checkbox appears and can be ticked/unticked\n\n\n\n\nThe last thing you need in your UI is the plot, which will be generated in the server function that you will customise in the next exercise.\n Think of a name to use to refer to your output plot, and as the last line within fluidPage, add plotOutput(\"name_of_output_plot\") (insert your choice of name)\n\n\n\nNow you will flesh out the server function to dynamically update the plot you included in the ui.\n Go to the server function part of your skeleton and flesh out the server logic:\n\nInside the curly braces {}, create an output using renderPlot(). The name of the output should be the same as the name you created in the ui in Exercise 7.\n\noutput$name_of_output_plot &lt;- renderPlot({\n\n  # your ggplot code will go here\n\n})\n\nUse an if/else pattern to check the value of the dropdown menu input. Remember to refer to the inputId you used when you defined the dropdown menu in the ui using the input$ notation. Within the if block, define the plot that should appear if the user selects one of the dropdown options; within the else block, define the plot that should appear if the user selects the other dropdown option. Each block should assign the ggplot code to a named object, like output_plot.\nAdd an if block that checks the value of the checkbox input, remembering to refer to the inputId you used when you defined the checkbox in the ui. Within the block, add a layer to the plot defined in step 2 if the user checks the checkbox.\nAdd a final line consisting just of the name of the plot you defined. This is needed to tell Shiny to draw the plot.\n\nOnce completed, your code will look something like this:\noutput$name_of_output_plot &lt;- renderPlot({\n\n  if (input$xxx == \"option1\") {\n    output_plot &lt;- my_df |&gt;\n      ggplot(aes(x = ..., y = ...)) +\n      geom_...\n  } else {\n    output_plot &lt;- my_df |&gt;\n      ggplot(aes(x = ..., y = ...)) +\n      geom_...\n  }\n\n  if (input$yyy)  {\n    output_plot &lt;- output_plot +\n      geom_...\n  }\n\n  output_plot\n})\n\n Save app.R and click Run App. Change the selection in your dropdown and check the box to confirm that the plot updates as intended.\n In your own words (as a comment in app.R), describe what each if/else block is doing.\n\n\n\nAt this point, you may want to polish the appearance of your plots. For example, you might:\n\nImprove the title of the shiny app\nImprove plot labels or colors\n\nTo help you understand and adapt this code in the future, you might want to add comments that explain what each part does, for example:\n\nAbove the data loading code\n\nAbove the ui &lt;- fluidPage(...) section\n\nAbove the server &lt;- function(...) { ... } section\n\nAbove any if/else blocks\n\n Imagine another student in the course downloads only your project_name/ folder. Would they be able to:\n\nUnderstand what the app is for?\n\nWork out what the inputs do?\n\nInterpret what the plot is showing?\n\nIf not, tweak labels and comments until the answer is “yes”.\n In a comment at the bottom of app.R, or in a separate text file in the project folder, briefly answer:\n\nWhat question is your app helping to answer about this dataset?\n\nWhat did you learn from turning your earlier analysis into an interactive app?\n\nIf you had more time, what is one extra feature you would add next?",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nSocial support and access to therapy are both thought to play an important role in protecting mental health. This short report uses a simulated dataset of 400 adults to explore how perceived support and therapy use relate to wellbeing and loneliness.\nParticipants reported their support level (low, medium, or high), whether they were currently in therapy, and completed assessments of wellbeing and loneliness that were subsequently scored. The aim of the report is to summarise how these variables relate to one another.\nThis report first examines how wellbeing and loneliness differ across support levels, and then reveals the impact of therapy.\nData overview\nThe dataset contains the following key variables:\n\n\nSupport level (support_level): perceived social support (Low, Medium, High).\n\nTherapy (therapy): whether the participant is currently receiving therapy (Yes/No).\n\nLoneliness score (loneliness_score): higher values indicate greater loneliness.\n\nWellbeing score (wellbeing_score): higher values indicate better wellbeing.\n\nIn what follows, I focus on how wellbeing and loneliness vary across levels of support and therapy.\nSupport level affects wellbeing and loneliness\nWe first examine wellbeing and loneliness scores by support level. The pattern is clear: participants with low perceived support report the lowest wellbeing and highest loneliness. As support increases, wellbeing also increases, whereas loneliness decreases. Thus, support improves wellbeing and decreases loneliness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Wellbeing scores by perceived support level.\n\n\n\n\nTherapy partially mitigates effects of support\nWe next compare wellbeing for participants who are and are not in therapy. On average, those in therapy report higher wellbeing than those who are not, across all levels of support. However, therapy does not affect reported levels of loneliness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Wellbeing scores for participants in therapy and not in therapy.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nThis short report used a simulated dataset to explore how social support, therapy, and sleep quality relate to wellbeing and loneliness. Key patterns emerged. First, higher perceived support is associated with higher wellbeing and lower loneliness. In addition, participants in therapy report somewhat higher wellbeing than those not in therapy. However, therapy has no apparent effect on reported loneliness.\nThe report demonstrates how Quarto can combine text, code, and figures to tell a coherent data story. In a full analysis, one might extend these descriptive findings using formal statistical models and explore additional predictors, such as age or sex. Here, the focus has been on producing a clear, reproducible summary that highlights key patterns in the data."

Take this numeric matrix and turn it into a more easy to grasp visual.\nAt this point we have a couple different options. There are various packages that people have written that visualize correlation matrices.",

This short report uses a simulated dataset of 400 adults to explore how perceived support and therapy use relate to wellbeing and loneliness.\nParticipants reported their support level (low, medium, or high), whether they were currently in therapy, and completed assessments of wellbeing and loneliness that were subsequently scored. The aim of the report is to summarise how these variables relate to one another.\nThis report first examines how wellbeing and loneliness differ across support levels, and then reveals the impact of therapy.\nData overview\nThe dataset contains the following key variables:\n\n\nSupport level (support_level): perceived social support (Low, Medium, High).\n\nTherapy (therapy): whether the participant is currently receiving therapy (Yes/No).\n\nLoneliness score (loneliness_score): higher values indicate greater loneliness.\n\nWellbeing score (wellbeing_score): higher values indicate better wellbeing.\n\nIn what follows, I focus on how wellbeing and loneliness vary across levels of support and therapy.\nSupport level affects wellbeing and loneliness\nWe first examine wellbeing and loneliness scores by support level. The pattern is clear: participants with low perceived support report the lowest wellbeing and highest loneliness. As support increases, wellbeing also increases, whereas loneliness decreases. Thus, support improves wellbeing and decreases loneliness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Wellbeing scores by perceived support level."

    "text": "So far, your consolidation exercises have been similar to the practical exercises, but with less guidance. To help you gain more independence in your work, this week’s consolidation exercise will be more open-ended.\nIn these consolidation exercises, you will take code from an earlier week and turn it into a short Quarto report, using the structure introduced in Week 8 and customization strategies introduced in Week 7. Practicing how to build a polished Quarto report will be useful preparation for both the final assessment and for communicating your work with other people.\nYou will:\n\nAdapt plots and wrangling code from one earlier week: Week 3, 4, 5, or 6\nSet up a project folder with a data/ subfolder\nCreate a Quarto report with a YAML header, setup chunk, and sections\nAdd chunk labels, chunk options, and inline code\nWrite short plain-language interpretations of your plots\n\nYou do not need to invent entirely new visualizations here. The goal is to practice turning code you have already written into a clear, reproducible report. To accomplish this goal, you can harness the polishing strategies from week 7 and the Quarto report approaches from week 8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\n\nThese four symbols are used at the beginning of each instruction so you know where to carry out the instruction.\n Something you need to do on your computer. It may be opening programs or documents or locating a file.\n Something you should do in RStudio. It will often be typing a command or using the menus but might also be creating folders, locating or moving files.\n Something you should do in your browser on the internet. It may be searching for information, going to the VLE or downloading a file.\n A question for you to think about and answer. Record your answers in your report or script for future reference.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose an earlier practical or consolidation as the basis for this Week 8 report, such as:\n\nWeek 4 — Barplots\n\nWeek 5 — Relationships\n\nWeek 6 — Time series & line graphs\n\n Open the R script from that week. Quickly skim what you did.\n In a sentence or two, jot down: - Which dataset you plan to use - Which 2–3 plots you want to showcase in your report.\nYou can keep this plan outline short; it’s just to orient yourself.\n\n\n\nNow you will create a fresh project specifically for this consolidation report, using the same structure as in the Week 8 practical.\n In RStudio, in the Files tab (Rstudio bottom right panel), create a new folder somewhere sensible (for example inside data-visualisation-in-r). Give it a clear name that relates to the graphs you will use in the report, such as consolidate8_barplots.\nWe will refer to this as project_name/.\nThis is the first step for building your project structure. Once you finish the additional setup steps below, your project structure should look like this:\nproject_name/\n  project_name.Rproj\n  consolidate8_report.qmd\n  data/\n    &lt;one or more CSV files&gt;\n  \n Turn this folder into an RStudio Project:\n\nClick the project dropdown in the top-right of RStudio (see the little icon with the blue cube)\n\nChoose New Project → Existing Directory\n\nSelect your new project_name/ folder and click Create Project.\n\n Inside this project, create a subfolder called data.\n Copy the relevant CSV file(s) from the original week into this data folder.\n Why is it helpful to keep all files needed for your report (data, .qmd, project file) together in one project folder?\n\n\n\nNow you will create the skeleton Quarto report.\n In RStudio (inside your new project):\n\nGo to File → New File → Quarto Document…\n\nGive it a clear title that mentions your topic and dataset, e.g.:\n\nEngagement Across User Segments and Devices\n\n\nList yourself as the author\nChoose HTML as the format.\n\nClick Create, then immediately save the file as consolidate8_report.qmd inside project_name/.\n\n Replace the default YAML at the top of the new .qmd with something similar to:\n---\ntitle: \"Engagement Across User Segments and Devices\"\nauthor: \"XXX\"\ndate: \"2025-11-15\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    toc-depth: 2\n    number-sections: false\n    self-contained: true\nexecute:\n  message: false\n  warning: false\n---\n What does the format: section of the YAML control?\n\n\n\nUnderneath the YAML, you now need a setup chunk that:\n\nLoads any packages you need\n\nReads in the relevant dataset(s) from the data/ folder\n\nDoes any basic recoding (e.g., factor ordering) or processing\n\nOptionally sets a default theme\n\n Test run the chunk within RStudio (using the green arrow). Fix any errors about missing packages or incorrect file paths.\n Save and Render your report.\n After your setup chunk runs successfully, what (if anything) do you see in the HTML report? Why?\n\n\n\nNext, you’ll add a clear section structure using Markdown headings.\n Underneath your setup chunk, add headings like:\n# Introduction\n\n# Data overview\n\n# [key result 1]\n\n# [key result 2]\n\n# Summary\nYou can adapt the key results to your topic, e.g., # App engagement by user segment\n\n\n\n In the # Data overview section, add a code chunk that shows the top few rows of the dataset and a brief Markdown description. Test run the chunk and render the file to check that everything runs / displays as intended.\n\n\n\nNow the main step: adapt plots from your earlier script and translate them into Quarto chunks inside your report.\nAim for at least two plots that form a coherent story (e.g., different views of the same phenomenon, or related outcomes).\n For each plot you want to include:\n\nCopy the ggplot code from your original script.\nPaste it into an R chunk in the appropriate section of your report.\nAdd a chunk label and useful chunk options\nTest run it to see how it looks.\nPolish the plot using strategies from Advanced Customisation (Week 7)\nRender and try adjusting the options controlling figure appearance until you’re happy with how it looks.\nAdd a brief description of the key result to the section.\n\n Repeat this for your other chosen plots. Remember that each of your code chunks should have a different label.\n\n\n\nConsidering your inspection of the dataset and the patterns:\n\nAdd a few sentences to the # Introduction section to introduce the dataset and the patterns that the report will depict.\nTry including a sentence that notes the number of participants in the dataset (or some other useful bit of information) with inline code.\nAdd a few sentences to the # Summary section to summarise the patterns shown in the plots.\n\n\n\n\n Render your report and read it through from beginning to end.
