This week you will learn how to build a report that embeds code and figures within a narrative. Reports are a useful tool for walking another person through your findings and ensuring that your work is reproducible.


### Learning objectives

The successful student will be able to:

- explain what a Quarto report is and why it is useful for reproducible data analysis

- build the structure of a Quarto report, and flesh it out with a combination of narrative text, code chunks, and figures to walk the reader through a project in the rendered report 

- polish the appearance of the report using Markdown to format the narrative text, and code chunk controls to control code visibility and the appearance of figures
