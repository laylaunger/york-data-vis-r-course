This week you will learn how to use bar plots to visualise categorical data. We will cover counts, proportions, and summary statistics, as well as how to handle grouped bar plots. 

### Learning objectives

The successful student will be able to:

-   generate bar plots to show counts of categorical variables
-   create bar plots of proportions to compare relative frequencies
-   plot summary statistics (e.g., means and error bars) for continuous outcomes by group
-   produce grouped bar plots to compare multiple categorical variables simultaneously
