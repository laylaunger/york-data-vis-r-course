This week you will be introduced to Shiny apps. Shiny apps allow you to build dynamic web apps in which people can interactively explore visualisations.  


### Learning objectives

The successful student will be able to:

- Explain what a Shiny app is and why we might use one
- Recognise the **anatomy** of a Shiny app:
  - `ui`, `server`, `shinyApp(ui, server)`
- Build a simple interactive app that:
  - Uses `selectInput()` and `checkboxInput()`
  - Updates a ggplot using `renderPlot()` and `plotOutput()`
- Organise `app.R` and data files in a project structure
