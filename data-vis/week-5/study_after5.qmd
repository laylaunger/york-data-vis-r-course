# Exercises

```{r}
#| include: false
# Load packages
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(tidyverse)
  library(here)
})

# Load data
ops_df <- read_csv(here("data-vis",  "data", "customer_ops.csv"))
```

## Set up

If you have just opened RStudio you will want to load the **`tidyverse`** package.

## Reading in data

![](images/do_on_your_computer.png) Save this file in your `week-5` folder:  

-   Customer operations dataset: [customer_ops.csv](../data/customer_ops.csv)

![](images/do_in_R.png) Add the following code to your R script and run:

```{r}
#| eval: false
ops_df <- read_csv("customer_ops.csv")
```

```{r}
head(ops_df)
```

## Exercise 1: Scatterplot

![](images/do_in_R.png) Make a scatterplot of `sleep_hours` (x-axis) versus `wellbeing_index` (y-axis).  
Add some transparency to the points using `alpha`.

Reflect: Does the relationship look positive, negative, or flat?


## Exercise 2: Trend line

![](images/do_in_R.png) Add a **linear model** line to the scatterplot using `geom_smooth(method = "lm")`.

Reflect: What does the slope suggest about the relationship?



## Exercise 3: Group differences

![](images/do_in_R.png) Plot `social_hours` vs `wellbeing_index`, colouring points by `participant_group`.  Add group-specific trend lines.

Reflect: Which group appears most negatively affected by social media hours?



## Exercise 4: Faceting

![](images/do_in_R.png) Re-make the plot of `social_hours` vs `wellbeing_index`, but facet by `participant_group`.  Try `scales = "free_x"` inside `facet_wrap()`.

Reflect: Why might faceting make patterns easier to compare?




## Exercise 5: Correlation matrix

![](images/do_in_R.png) Select the numeric columns of your dataset. Compute a correlation matrix with `cor()`.  Plot it with `geom_tile()` and customise the gradient scale.

Reflect: Which variables are most strongly related to `wellbeing_index`?
