# Practice

Continue working on the **`tidyverse`** course on DataCamp if not yet complete.


# Exercises

```{r}
#| include: false
# Load packages
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(tidyverse)
  library(ggridges)
  library(here)
})

# Load data
stress_df <- read_csv(here("data-vis",  "data", "stress_data.csv"))


```


## Set up:

If you have just opened RStudio you will want to load the
**`tidyverse`** and **`ggridges`** packages

## Reading in data

![](images/do_on_your_computer.png) Save this file in your `week-3` folder:

-   Data from fictional stress study: [stress_data.csv](../data/stress_data.csv)

![](images/do_in_R.png) Add the following code to your R script and run:



```{r}
#| eval: false
stress_df <- read_csv("stress_data.csv")
```

```{r}
head(stress_df)
```

## Exercise 1: Histogram Practice

![](images/do_in_R.png) Make a histogram of `stress_score`. Try two different bin settings and briefly note what changes. 

Reflect: How does the bin size influence the level of fine detail you can see in the data?



## Exercise 2: Density Overlay Practice

![](images/do_in_R.png) Overlay a density curve and histogram of `stress_score.` Alter colors / alpha levels so that it is easy to see both the density curve and histogram.


## Exercise 3: Categorical Distributions Practice

![](images/do_in_R.png) Compare `stress_score` across `diagnosis` groups using either a boxplot or a violin (your choice). Add jittered points (transparent) and mark the mean with stat_summary().


Reflect: Do the means and medians overlap? Are there group differences between diagnoses?

# Exercise 4: Wrangling and Density Ridges

What if we want to make the difference in `stress_score` across `diagnosis` groups more clear by ordering the diagnosis groups from highest to lowest `stress_score`? 

![](images/do_in_R.png) We can "mutate" the `diagnosis` variable by reordering it according to mean `stress_score` within each diagnosis group:

```{r}
stress_df <- stress_df %>%
  mutate(diagnosis = fct_reorder(diagnosis, stress_score, .fun = mean, .desc = TRUE))
```

![](images/do_in_R.png) Generate a ridgeline plot that compares the density curves of `stress_sore` for the different diagnoses. Color the ridges by `diagnosis` and alter the alpha level so that all curves are visible.

# ðŸ¥³ Well Done! ðŸŽ‰
