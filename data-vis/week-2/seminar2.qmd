## From last time

<br>

Why do we visualise data?

- Explore
- Diagnose
- Explain

---

## Today

<br>

The grammar of graphics 

- How graphics are constructed in R (standard)

---

## Packages

<br>

To expand R's capabilities, we often need to use packages

The main package we'll be using to generate graphics is ggplot2


```{r load-ggplot2, eval = FALSE}

install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

```

## ggplot

<br>

<div style="font-size: 80%;">

What is the <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">g</span>rammar of <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">g</span>raphics?

A framework for building plots by combining basic building blocks, e.g.,:

- geometric objects (like points or bars)
- data
- visual mappings (like position and color)

in a consistent, structured way

## How do we "map" data to a graphic?

<br>

<div style="font-size: 75%;">

The way we depict variables in our data as axes, bars, points, etc. dictates the way that patterns such as comparisons and changes are perceived

A non-exhaustive list:

- length
- color (or saturation)
- position
- size
- shape
- area
- angle

</div>

```

::: notes

We can choose a variable to plot

:::

---

## ggplot

```{r histogram-plot, eval = FALSE}



ggplot(data = psych_df, aes(x = stress_score)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

::: notes

But we need to tell ggplot what GEOMETRY to use to visualize that variable. 
Here, a histogram

:::

```{r histogram-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 5}
```




---

## ggplot

```{r boxplot-plot, eval = FALSE}

ggplot(data = psych_df, aes(x = diagnosis, y = stress_score)) +
  geom_boxplot()

```

::: notes

Now, what if we wanted to keep looking at that distribution of stress, but break
it down by diagnosis? Here, we need to add that diagnosis variable as an axis
and choose a geometry to depict it. We'll try boxplot.

:::


```{r boxplot-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 5}
```




---

## ggplot


```{r violinplot-plot, eval = FALSE}

ggplot(data = psych_df, aes(x = diagnosis, y = stress_score)) +
  geom_violin()

```

```{r violinplot-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 5}
```

::: notes

Or violin plot

:::


---

## ggplot



```{r barplot-plot, eval = FALSE}

psych_df %>%
  group_by(diagnosis) %>%
  summarize(stress_score_mean = mean(stress_score)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = diagnosis, y = stress_score_mean)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")

```

::: notes

What if we don't want to look at the full distribution - we just want to
look at the average tendencies for each diagnosis? 
Well here we want a bar plot. But we need to calculate that average tendency 
somehow. 

One way to do that would be to use the data to calculate the averages first, and
then plot them.

:::



```{r barplot-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 5}
```

---

## ggplot


```{r scatterplot-plot, eval = FALSE}

psych_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sleep_hours, y = stress_score)) +
  geom_point()

```

::: notes

Suppose we want to see, beyond diagnosis, are there variables associated with
stress? How about sleep? Now we're looking at a relationship between continuous
variables, so the appropriate choice here is a scatterplot. So the geeometry 
we'll use is points in a scatterplot.

:::


```{r scatterplot-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 5}
```

---

## ggplot



```{r scatterplot-plot-diagnosis-color, eval = FALSE}

psych_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sleep_hours, y = stress_score)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = diagnosis))

```

::: notes

What if we want to incorporate another variable into this plot. 
E.g., what if we want to visualize stress, sleep AND diagnosis?
We can control another aesthetic using the diagnosis variable - e.g.,
point color

:::


```{r scatterplot-plot-diagnosis-color, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 5}
```

---

## ggplot


```{r scatterplot-plot-diagnosis-shape, eval = FALSE}

psych_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sleep_hours, y = stress_score)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = diagnosis))

```

::: notes

We could use diagnosis to control another aesthetic, like shape

:::

```{r scatterplot-plot-diagnosis-shape, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 5}
```


---

## ggplot


```{r scatterplot-plot-diagnosis-color2, eval = FALSE}

psych_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = stress_score, y = diagnosis)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = sleep_hours))

```

::: notes

We could change the way we map our variables to aesthetics - axes, shapes

:::


```{r scatterplot-plot-diagnosis-color2, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 5}
```

Facets are especially handy when we have some pattern of relationships between some

::: notes

What if we want to see how this relationship varies across another variable? 
Like different diagnoses?
Too much to combine into a single plot

```{r scatterplot-plot-facet1, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 5}

::: notes

```{r scatterplot-plot-facet2, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 5}

---

## Summary: Grammar of Graphics

- Minimum for plot = data + aes() + geom()

- Map variables to aesthetics: x, y, color/fill, shape, size, alpha, linetype.

- Pick geoms to match the question: hist/box/violin (distributions), bar (summaries/counts), point (relationships).

- Use stats when needed: stat_summary() for means/SE; stat="identity" when you’ve already computed values.

- Tune scales & labels: scale_*_*(), labs().

- Adjust axes/orientation: coord_cartesian(), coord_flip(), coord_polar().

- Polish appearance: theme(), built-ins (theme_bw())

- Compare subsets with facets: facet_wrap() / facet_grid().

---

## Workflow checklist

- Start with a clear question.

- Choose mappings (what goes to x/y/color/…?).

- Select geom (how should it look?).

- Add stat/facet if it clarifies the story.

- Refine with scales/coord; label units.

- Finish with theme

- Check clarity & integrity
